## Welcome!

(You'll want to clone this into "C:\Users\*username*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates".)

I made this because I *really* like dark mode. I recommend setting text color to "Gray, Text 1" and page color to "Black, Background 1" for viewing and switching to "Text 2" and "Background 2" when you're ready to view.

### There are also some macros!

- AutoOpen: should give you the option to return to where you left off! (or do it for you?)

- CursorUp & CursorDown
  - These fix a weird behavior where, when in multiple-page view, moving the cursor with the up or down arrow moves to the page **shown** above or below the current page, instead of the sequential next or previous one.
  - I recommend [customizing the shorcut](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/customize-keyboard-shortcuts-9a92343e-a781-4d5a-92f1-0f32e3ba5b4d) to these macros (you can find "Macros" in the categories menu and then select the one you want to change shortcuts for in the "Commands" menu) as "Up" and "Down" respectively. This will overwrite a previous pairing, but that's the one with the weird behavior anyways so don't worry about it.
- CursorUpExtend & CursorDownExtend
  - These allow you to select sections of text within the behavior set of the fixes above.
  - I recommend customizing the shorcut to these macros as "Ctrl+Up" and "Ctrl+Down" respectively. Again, this will overwrite a previous pairing.
